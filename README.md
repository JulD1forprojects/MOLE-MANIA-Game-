## &#128992; **About this game**

Mole Mania is a modified version of “Whack a mole” game designed to test player’s attention, reaction and dexterity. This game is designed for a solo player where the player is presented with three levels of challenge - Easy, Medium & Hard. The challenge levels differ in terms of frequency of how often 3 Mole Sprites are displayed in the game boxes. Pleayer needs to score as much as possible within the presented timeframe by catching the Correct Mole Sprite and generating more coins.

## **Instructions**

Mole Mania can be palyed on mouse click, with keyboard keys or both at the same time.
Player must try to catch the Correct Mole by clicking either on the mouse or the set of keyboard keys as frequently as Correct Mole sprite is displayed in the boxes within the timeframe of 30sec. Player will score incrementally according to how many times he/she manages to catch the Correct Mole Sprite. If the correct Mole Sprite gets caught 5 times, player is rewarded with 1 coin (5 CORRECT MOLES CAUGHT => 1 COIN REWARD). If player catches a Wrong Mole sprite, his/her points toghether with earned coins be decremented from the score (1 WRONG MOLES CAUGHT => - 1 POINT and - 1 COIN REWARD)
